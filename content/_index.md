#### What is Trinami?

_Trinami is an attempt to create a global algocracy concept that aims to represent not only the state but also the most important economic processes._

The following characteristics of such a system are the most important: 

- everyone should be treated equally
- decisions should be made with as little central authority as possible
- a central authority should have no access to individual data
- individuals must be able to participate in social life anonymously
- the system must be secure against hostile actors
- economic movements must be transparent to everyone.
